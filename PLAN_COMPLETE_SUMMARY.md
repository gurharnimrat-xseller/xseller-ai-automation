## 📋 10 NOTION AI PROMPTS (Copy-Paste Ready):

See **[NOTION_AI_GUIDE.md](./NOTION_AI_GUIDE.md)** for full details.

**Quick Start** (Do these first):

1. Open any M4 or M5 task → Inside the page → Press Space → Notion AI
2. Paste: *"Create comprehensive implementation guide with 8 sections: Overview, Tasks, Technical Approach, Code Structure, Acceptance Criteria, Testing, Pitfalls, Resources"*
3. Review and insert
4. Repeat for all 7 M4/M5 tasks
5. Then expand M1-M3 tasks the same way

---

## 🚨 ERRORS FOUND & FIXED:

### **Error 1: Summary Truncation** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Notion properties limited to 2000 chars
- **Impact**: Some M4/M5 tasks cut off at 2000 chars
- **Fix**: Reduced to 1900 chars with safety buffer
- **Status**: ✅ All tasks now fit within limit

### **Error 2: M4/M5 Missing Details** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Only summary entries for M4/M5 initially
- **Impact**: Week 4-5 tasks not detailed enough
- **Fix**: Created and ran `complete_m4_m5.py`
- **Result**: Added 7 detailed tasks (M4A, M4B, M4C, M5A, M5B, M5C, M5D)
- **Status**: ✅ All milestones now equally detailed

### **Error 3: Page Content Empty** 🟡 PARTIAL
- **Issue**: Tasks only have property data, empty page bodies
- **Impact**: Can't see full details without clicking into properties
- **Fix**: Use Notion AI to add rich content inside each page
- **Status**: 🟡 Waiting for you to run Phase 2 (Notion AI prompts)

### **Error 4: No Dependencies Mapped** ⚪ TODO
- **Issue**: Don't know which tasks depend on others
- **Impact**: May work on tasks in wrong order
- **Fix**: Use Notion AI prompt #5 (Dependency Maps)
- **Status**: ⚪ Add in Phase 2

### **Error 5: No Visual Diagrams** ⚪ TODO
- **Issue**: All text, no process flows or architecture diagrams
- **Impact**: Harder to understand system at a glance
- **Fix**: Use Notion AI Bonus prompts (Process Diagrams)
- **Status**: ⚪ Add in Phase 2
